Install:

1. Python,
2. Sublime Text 3

How do I complete this project?

1. Write a movie Class in media.py. This Python file contains the information of properties of movie e.g. movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

2. write a constructor for the movie class so that you can create instances of movie. You can now create a list of these movie objects in entertainment_center.py by calling the constructor media.Movie() to instantiate movie objects. 

3. The fresh_tomatoes.py module has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies, and creates an HTML file which will display all of your favorite movies.
This file is used inside entertainment_center.py file.

Project Overview :

The Movie Trailer Website project consists of server-side code to store a list of movies 
titles, along with its respective box art imagery and movie trailer website. The data 
should be served as a web page allowing visitors to review the movies and watch the trailers:


The following link is the home page where movies are laid out:

file:///Users/Dalia/Documents/FSS-1-movie/fresh_tomatoes.html

That page allows users to click on a movie image to watch its trailer.
